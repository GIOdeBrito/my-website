					<h1>About me</h1>

			<section>
				<p>
					Ever since I was a little boy, technology has always fascinated me,
					from simple remotely controlled toy cars, to more complex machines such as gaming consoles and computers.
				</p>

				<p>
					Today I am a <mark name='outline'>self-learned web and desktop developer</mark>, studying and practicing, either for fun or for
					learning, basically non-stop since my 16 years old. Web was not always my primary focus though; it came much later, as
					<mark name='outline'>I began my journey in programming writing code in the Unity3D engine</mark>, using MonoDelevop as IDE
					back when the Boo language was still available, with the now defunct UnityScript — a peculiar but also rather curious kind
					of JavaScript for game development, it was, indeed, a form of typed JS, way before Microsoft coined the well-known TypeScript.
				</p>

				<p>
					When I am not programming I enjoy <mark name='outline'>reading history and fantasy books.</mark> Working on other side personal projects,
					such as translating and lettering books and comics, editing videos for me or my friends, researching about ancient dead languages of old,
					et cetera. At times, I am also keen to trying new cooking recipes when I am in the mood to get my hands dirty in the kitchen.
				</p>

				<p>
					I am very fond of videogames as they have been a big part of my life ever since — although I do not play as much in the current past years —
					and <mark name='outline'>I had my first contact with the English language through story-driven RPGs</mark>, and gaming was
					one of the key factors to motivate me to learn it. My favorite games include: Demon's Souls, Final Fantasy X, God Hand,
					Fallout New Vegas, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and DOOM 2016 are a few.

					<h1>Programming Languages & Technologies</h1>
				</header>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>
					In this section lies the programming languages and various technologies I have used
					throughout my time learning, or even working, how computing work. I have gazed upon many waters
					of the information technology field and creating computer softwares and systems was the one I liked the most
					and I decided to follow this path.
				</p>

				<p>
					After Unity I have tried a range of technologies in search for something that might suit me. The ones below
					are the ones I invested my time in, despite some of them not being in my current scope at the moment, I still retain
					the knowledge I got from working with them.
