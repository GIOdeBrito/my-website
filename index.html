				<p>
					Ever since I was a young boy, technology has always fascinated me,
					from simple remotely controled toy cars, to more complex machines such as gaming consoles and computers.
				</p>

				<p>
					At a remote time, my childhood dream was the possession of a Sony's PlayStation 2, but my family could not afford it. And with that
					in mind, I told my father, as we made our way back from a trip, that one day I would make my very own
					videogames, that I and everyone else would play them and have fun.
				</p>

				<p>And as time went on, I eventually fulfilled my own promise.</p>

				<p>
					Today I am a self-learned web developer, studying and practicing, for fun, basically non-stop since my 16 years old. But web was
					not my primary focus, I began coding in the Unity3D engine, with the now defunct UnityScript â€” a peculiar but also interesting version
					of JavaScript, it was typed JS, way before Microsoft invented the well-known TypeScript.
