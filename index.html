					<h1>About me</h1>
				</header>
			</section>

			<section>
				<p>
					Ever since I was a little boy, technology has always fascinated me,
					from simple remotely controled toy cars, to more complex machines such as gaming consoles and computers.
				</p>

				<p>
					Today I am a <mark name='outline'>self-learned web and desktop developer</mark>, studying and practicing, either for fun or for learning,
					basically non-stop since my 16 years old. Web was not always my primary focus though, it came much later, as
					<mark name='outline'>I began my journey in programming writing code in the Unity3D engine</mark>, using MonoDelevop as IDE
					back when the Boo language was still available, with the now defunct UnityScript — a peculiar but also rather curious kind
					of JavaScript for game development, it was, indeed, a form of typed JS, way before Microsoft coined the well-known TypeScript.
				</p>

				<p>
					When I am not programming I enjoy <mark name='outline'>reading history and fantasy books.</mark> Working on other side personal projects,
					such as translating and lettering books and comics, editing videos for me or my friends, et cetera. At times, I am also keen to trying new
					cooking recipes when I am in the mood to get my hands dirty in the kitchen.
				</p>

				<p>
					I am very fond of videogames and I do not hide my love for them, also <mark name='outline'>I had my first contact with the english
					language through gaming</mark>, and story-driven RPGs were the key factor to motivate me to learn it. My favorite games include:
					Demon's Souls, Final Fantasy X, God Hand, Fallout New Vegas, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, and many others.

					Ever since I was a young boy, technology has always fascinated me,
					from simple remotely controled toy cars, to more complex machines such as gaming consoles and computers.
				</p>

				<p>
					At a remote time, my childhood dream was the possession of a Sony's PlayStation 2, but my family could not afford it. And with that
					in mind, I told my father, as we made our way back from a trip, that one day I would make my very own
					videogames, that I and everyone else would play them and have fun.
				</p>

				<p>And, as time went on, I did eventually fulfilled my own promise.</p>

				<p>
					Today I am a self-learned web developer, studying and practicing, for fun, basically non-stop since my 16 years old. Web was
					not always my primary focus though, as I began my journey in programming coding in the Unity3D engine, with the now defunct UnityScript — a
					peculiar but also rather interesting version of JavaScript, it was, indeed, a form of typed JS, way before Microsoft coined the
					well-known TypeScript.
